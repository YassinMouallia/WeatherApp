# WeatherApp
WeatherApp is an Angular web application that uses the latest version of Angular (19.0.4) and Bootstrap (5.3.3).
This web application's main function is to show the user the user the current weather given the user input(eg : London,Cairo,Tunis...) using the Open Weather API (more information here: https://openweathermap.org/current)


and displays the following information to the User:
```bash
+ Current Weather
+ Weather Description
+ The Current Temperature
+ Humidity
+ Wind speed
+ Wind direction
+ Pressure
+ The time of sunrise
+ The time of sunset
```









## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
